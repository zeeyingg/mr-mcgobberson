K09 -- Some Things Never Change
time spent: 0.5 hours


OUR PREDICTIONS:
- We think accessing both links will bring you to the plaintext files.

What ACTUALLY happens once you access the link...

- The foo file gives you the option to download (on Vivaldi) or automaticlaly downloads the file once accessed (on Firefox)
- foo.html brings you to a webpage with text generated on it 

NOTES:
- It is NOT plaintext because there are html markers surrounding the text
- foo is the only file with plaintext -- the contents can only be accessed through opening the file on a local machine
- The local server can display a file in different ways
- Links cannot be accessed if you do not run app.py and a local host server is not set up
- Is there a way to return the link in the terminal?
