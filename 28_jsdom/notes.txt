DISCOs:
* .value access the value of the element
* Add multiple event listeners to an element
* For input to be refreshed, the value of the input must be reassigned

QCCs:
* What is the difference between a "var" and a "cons" type?
* Why is instating an object useful?
* What is the preferred syntax for writing JS? 
* Is the script tag meant to go at the end of the HTML file? Are suspectabilities to errors increased if it's not?
