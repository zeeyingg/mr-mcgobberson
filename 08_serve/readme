DISCOS:
- In order to have information displayed on a webpage, use HTML markers wrapped in Strings. 
For instance, we figured out that in order to create a line break, you must used "<br>", not "\n"
- In a module, there must only be one return statement culminating all the information to be displayed on the webpage.

QCC:
- What is app.debug? What does setting it True do?
- What is the Debugger PIN?
- What is a module? Why is it important in Flask?
- Why doesn't the page display the result of multiple functions? 
- Is printing the __name__ necessary?
