K19 - Flask app that uses session capabilites to allow user to login and logout
2022-11-03
time spent:

HOW IT WORKS:
- we have three app routes:

1. / <- root directory

IF LOGGED OUT:
* renders login.html, which prompts for login information

IF LOGGED IN:
* renders reponse.html and displays the username in session

2. /login
- renders login.html
- form to collect username and password
- submit button
- after login info is submitted, if user/pass are wrong, will display message at bottom reading "Bad username." or "Bad password."

3. /response
- renders reponse.html
- displays our team name and roster
- has a logout button
- the logout button will send a form to the route /logout, which ends the session and displays the login page again

DISCOS:
* request.args gets data from a form using "GET" method
* request.form gets data from a form using "POST" method
* a cookie contains a unique session ID and returned when the server is requested again
* you can use session to temporarily store data as in the case of using session['username'],
allowing it to be accessed across different pages
* when a user is logged out, the session variable is removed
* logout button created within a form in order to work
* adding in secret key variable

QCCs:
* What exactly does the app secret key do?
* How does routing work?
* establishing cookies within a session
