time spent:

DISCOS:
* request.args gets data from a form using "GET" method
* request.form gets data from a form using "POST" method
* a cookie contains a unique session ID and returned when the server is requested again
* you can use session to temporarily store data as in the case of using session['username'],
allowing it to be accessed across different pages
* when a user is logged out, the session variable is removed

QCCs:
* What exactly does the app secret key do?
* How does routing work?
