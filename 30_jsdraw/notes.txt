DISCO:
* window.pageXOffset / window.pageYOffset returns the number of pixels that the document is currently scrolled horizontally / vertically
* The position of the cursor is relative to its positon on the webpage

QCC:
* Why do you need three "==="s for the if statement?
* When do you create an anonymous function and when do you want to just pass an argument?
