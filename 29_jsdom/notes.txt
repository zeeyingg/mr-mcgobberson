K29 -- Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
2023-04-03t

DISCOs:
* Using arrow syntax, the left part denotes the input of a function and the right part the output of the function.
* Even when the red class is added to all <li> element, items 1 to items 6 are still blue.  No semicolons required in JS for it to run; standard convention dictates it's better to add them anyways
* .value access the value of the element lambda(x) is the function used to define a procedure in Scheme
* Add multiple event listeners to an element JS is run through the dev console
* For input to be refreshed, the value of the input must be reassigned

QCCs:
* What is the difference between a "var" and a "cons" type? Can JS only be run in the dev console?
* Why is instating an object useful? What are the first three lines of the file used for?
* What is the preferred syntax for writing JS?  
* Is the script tag meant to go at the end of the HTML file? Are suspectabilities to errors increased if it's not?
