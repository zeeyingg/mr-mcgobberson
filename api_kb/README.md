# Ye Olde SoftDev API Knowledge Base
_Your first stop on the path to productivity!_

## USAGE:
- Before utilizing an API in any work or project, consult this KB. If a card does not yet exist for the API in question, one must be created:
  - `cp 000_on_template.md 411_on_APINAME.md`
- Devo or team creating a card will research and test it, then record their findings on the card.
- Other Devos utilizing a card will update it with corrections/addenda as necessary.
