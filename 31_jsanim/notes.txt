K31 -- canvas based JS animation
2023-04-25t

DISCO: 
* the placement of window.requestAnimationFrame and window.cancelAnimationFrame matters
* requestID is the frame of the animation

QCC:
* why is the callback function in window.requestAnimationFrame drawDot? is this like a recursive function?
* what does cancelAnimationFrame actually do? is the animation frame no longer associated with requestanimationframe? what exactly happens?
* the reason why the canvas needs to be cleared first is so that when the circle shrinks, older circles aren't shown
* does the number of circles on the canvas affect performance? if there are multiple circles in the same place, are they treated as multiple circles or as one circle?
