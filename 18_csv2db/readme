DISCO:
- In our initial code, the f-string was formatted incorrectly,
which is why it didn't work
i.e.

        original: 
        new: row[{'code'}]
- DictReader() reads contents and then maps the info onto key:value
pairs AKA dictionary objects
- .fetchall() returns all the selected rows

QCC:
- What other ways can we employ DictReader?
- How do we format the output to actually look like a spreadsheet?
