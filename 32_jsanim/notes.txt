DISCO:
    1. < var logo = new Image(); logo.src = "logo_dvd.jpg"; > Allows for loading and 
    2. ctx.drawImage(logo, rectX, rectY, rectWidth, rectHeight); drawing the logo
    3. windows.requestAnimationFrame "whatever" tells the browser to prepare the next animation frame
    4. The code uses arrow functions to define the "clear" function and the "drawDot" function. Arrow functions are a shorthand for creating functions, 
        and can be useful for reducing code verbosity, but they may be less clear to readers who are not familiar with the syntax.
    5.The code defines some variables using "var" instead of "let" or "const". "Var" variables are function-scoped, which can make them more error-prone 
        than block-scoped variables. Using "let" or "const" can help prevent bugs caused by variable redeclarations or incorrect scoping.
    6. Can Define functions in function in js !
QCC:
    1. How does the "cancelAnimationFrame" function work? Why is it used in the "stopIt" function? 
    2. When do we want to Define functions in function in js ! ? 
    3. Are there any performance concerns with the animations? Could they slow down or become 
        choppy on older or less powerful devices? How could this be optimized?
